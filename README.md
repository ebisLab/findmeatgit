# FindMe@Git

## About

Find Me at Git is a user search directory that re-implements a portion of GitHub's Search feature using their public API.

## Site features

1. Able to search input's related results
2. Access User's Followers and visit their Github
3. Navigate through list of results

## Tools used

* React framework
* Framer Motion - animation effect
* Axios to fetch data 
* Boostrap for pagination styling
* CSS


## Some Notes

* Github API limits to 1000 search results per call. This limit affects searches performance, and for the project of this size I decided to cut it down to 100 results to help increase the loading time. 

## Getting Started

All of the below dependencies can be installed using: yarn install or npm install

`Start development by creating a react app using: yarn start or npm start`

## Project future updates

* Clean up bugs
* Iron out animation keyframes and occasional styling incosistencies
* Responsiveness
* Filtering based off Location/Profession
* testing
* backend to handle request
